**📣 Introducing Undictify: The Social Media Blocker That *Really* Means It**

Are you tired of losing your weekdays to the black hole of social media scrolling? Do you ever catch yourself on Instagram for “just 5 minutes” only to emerge 2 hours later having accomplished absolutely nothing besides discovering what your ex’s cousin’s dog had for brunch?

Well, we were too.

That’s why we built **Undictify** — the **only app brave (and annoying) enough to stop you from self-sabotaging your productivity**.

# 🚫 What Is Undictify?

**Undictify** is a ruthless, slightly mischievous app that blocks your access to social media *when you need it most* — during the workweek.

Here’s how it works:

* **Every Monday**, Undictify logs into your Instagram and **changes your password**.
* Your access is completely sealed. No doomscrolling. No “quick story check.” No cheating.
* **Every Friday**, we **give you your password back** so you can enjoy your weekend like a true dopamine junkie.

Yes, it’s kind of like having a responsible friend babysit your digital vices — except this one doesn’t flake or forget.

## 😈 Want to Disable the Blocker? Good Luck.

Undictify is not your average “click here to turn off” kind of blocker.

If you try to disable the blocking feature, you’ll be met with a *glorious*, *deliberately frustrating*, *quiz* designed to make you question your life decisions.

We’re talking about:

* **Mind-numbing tasks** like “Please list the entire English alphabet. Backwards. Twice.”
* **Moral guilt trips** like “Do you *really* want to throw away your goals today?”
* **Philosophical quandaries** such as “Would Plato have scrolled Reels or stuck to scrolls?”
* **Absurd multiple-choice riddles** that make you go, “…why is this so hard?”

Yes, we could’ve made this easy. But that would defeat the purpose.
We’re here to protect you **from you** — even if it annoys you a little.

## 📱 Currently Available for Instagram. More Coming Soon.

Right now, Undictify supports **Instagram** only. But don’t get too comfortable — we’re gearing up to **invade more platforms** like TikTok, Twitter (X?), Facebook, and more.

Your weekdays are about to get a whole lot quieter. And more productive.

---

## 🚀 Why We Built This

We’re not anti-social media. We’re anti-*mindless* social media.

Undictify isn’t here to punish you — it’s here to **give your time back**, help you **reclaim your focus**, and make weekends feel like a reward, not a relapse.

We believe you can do amazing things — if your thumb stops scrolling long enough to let your brain catch up.

## ✅ Try It Today

You can install Undictify now and let Monday be the day you finally stop kidding yourself about cutting down your screen time.

And hey — if you want to cheat, you can always take the quiz. Just… be warned.
